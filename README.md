# How Github Works

A pull request in GitHub is a way to propose changes to a codebase. It's a critical part of the collaborative development workflow, allowing developers to contribute to projects managed by others. Here's a breakdown of how a pull request works:

1. **Forking a Repository**: When you want to contribute to a project, you first fork the repository to create your own copy.

2. **Making Changes**: You clone your forked repository to your local machine, make changes, and commit them to a new branch.

3. **Creating a Pull Request**: Once you're ready to share your changes, you push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository. This pull request includes details about the changes you've made and why they should be merged.

4. **Reviewing Changes**: The repository maintainers and other contributors review your pull request. They may ask for further changes, suggest improvements, or discuss the implementation.

5. **Merging**: If the maintainers approve your changes, they will merge the pull request into the original repository. Your changes will then become part of the project.

6. **Closing**: If the changes are not accepted, the pull request can be closed without merging.

Pull requests help maintain code quality, foster collaboration, and allow for controlled integration of new features or fixes.
